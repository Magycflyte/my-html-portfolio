    <h1>Top 3 Favourite Films</h1>
    <h2>according to Lucy</h2>

    <h3>1. Brave (2012)</h3>
    <p>I love Brave because it’s set in Scotland and beautifully captures the landscapes, 
    legends, and spirit of her homeland. She appreciates Merida’s independence and courage, 
    qualities she admires and relates to. The film also reminds her of childhood trips to the 
    Highlands with her family.</p>

    <h3>2. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)</h3>
    <p>I enjoy this film for its uplifting message about stepping out of one’s comfort zone and 
    embracing adventure. As someone who loves traveling and photography, she finds the cinematography 
    inspiring. It’s the kind of movie that fills her with motivation and wanderlust.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>3. Little Women (2019)</h3>
    <p>Lucy admires the emotional depth, strong character development, and artistic style of Little Women. 
    She especially identifies with the themes of creativity, independence, and finding one’s own path 
    in life. She often says this film sparks her motivation for creative projects.</p>
